1. **Question**: What is the average monthly sale value of the Diamond package across the 7 regions (to the nearest £)?
   **Solution**:
   Sum of Diamond sales = 6,125 (North) + 4,765 (North-East) + 5,700 (East) + 6,800 (South-East) + 3,630 (South) + 5,300 (South-West) + 5,450 (West) = 37,770.
   Average = 37,770 / 7 ≈ 5,395.71.
   Rounding to the nearest £ gives £5,396.
   **Answer**: 5,396

2. **Question**: In which region was the second highest total number of Platinum, Executive and Premium packages sold (over the previous month)?
   **Options**: North, North-East, East, South-East, South, South-West, West
   **Solution**:
   Calculate totals for Platinum + Executive + Premium for each region:
   * North: 4,630 + 3,765 + 6,100 = 14,495
   * North-East: 8,965 + 8,600 + 3,765 = 21,330
   * East: 6,725 + 6,000 + 5,450 = 18,175
   * **South-East**: 8,700 + 6,120 + 6,760 = **21,580** (2nd Highest)
   * South: 6,800 + 8,760 + 4,900 = 20,460
   * South-West: 3,775 + 6,265 + 5,070 = 15,110
   * **West**: 8,600 + 8,965 + 6,125 = **23,690** (Highest)
   **Answer**: South-East

3. **Question**: A customer purchases a Diamond contract and then switches 6 months later to a Platinum contract due to a sale deal of 20% off the monthly Platinum package cost. What's the total cost for the customer over the two contract periods?
   **Solution**:
   Diamond Contract Cost: 6 months (contract length) × £40/month = £240.
   Platinum Contract Cost:
   * Standard Monthly Cost: £45.
   * Discounted Price: £45 - (20% of £45) = £45 - £9 = £36.
   * Platinum Contract Length: 24 months.
   * Total Platinum Cost: 24 × £36 = £864.
   Total Cost = £240 (Diamond) + £864 (Platinum) = £1,104.
   **Answer**: 1,104
