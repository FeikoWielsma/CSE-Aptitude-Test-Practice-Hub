1. **Question**: What is the average monthly sale value of the Diamond package across the 7 regions (to the nearest £)?
   **Solution**:
   Sum of Diamond sales = 6,125 (North) + 4,765 (North-East) + 5,700 (East) + 6,800 (South-East) + 3,630 (South) + 5,300 (South-West) + 5,450 (West) = 37,770.
   Average = 37,770 / 7 ≈ 5,395.71.
   Rounding to the nearest £ gives £5,396.
   **Answer**: 5,396

2. **Question**: In which region was the second highest total number of Platinum, Executive and Premium packages sold (over the previous month)?
   **Options**: North, North-East, East, South-East, South, South-West, West
   **Solution**:
   Calculate totals for Platinum + Executive + Premium for each region:
   * North: 4,630 + 3,765 + 6,100 = 14,495
   * North-East: 8,965 + 8,600 + 3,765 = 21,330
   * East: 6,725 + 6,000 + 5,450 = 18,175
   * **South-East**: 8,700 + 6,120 + 6,760 = **21,580** (2nd Highest)
   * South: 6,800 + 8,760 + 4,900 = 20,460
   * South-West: 3,775 + 6,265 + 5,070 = 15,110
   * **West**: 8,600 + 8,965 + 6,125 = **23,690** (Highest)
   **Answer**: South-East

3. **Question**: A customer purchases a Diamond contract and then switches 6 months later to a Platinum contract due to a sale deal of 20% off the monthly Platinum package cost. What's the total cost for the customer over the two contract periods?
   **Solution**:
   Diamond Contract Cost: 6 months (contract length) × £40/month = £240.
   Platinum Contract Cost:
   * Standard Monthly Cost: £45.
   * Discounted Price: £45 - (20% of £45) = £45 - £9 = £36.
   * Platinum Contract Length: 24 months.
   * Total Platinum Cost: 24 × £36 = £864.
   Total Cost = £240 (Diamond) + £864 (Platinum) = £1,104.
   **Answer**: 1,104

## Question 2
**Table 1: Share Price and Dividend**

| Share | Yearly Dividend (pence) Jan-June | Yearly Dividend (pence) July-Dec | Today's Price (£) | Previous Week's Price Lowest (£) | Previous Week's Price Highest (£) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Acorn** | 45 | 15 | 14 | 13.5 | 15.25 |
| **EDP** | 15 | 60 | 13.1 | 12.8 | 14.25 |
| **Jasone** | 20 | 50 | 12.5 | 11.75 | 12.3 |
| **Kilic** | 30 | 35 | 9.25 | 8.65 | 10.05 |
| **Soares** | 10 | 30 | 8.1 | 7.85 | 8.8 |
| **Safron** | 35 | 35 | 13.8 | 13.65 | 13.95 |
| **Troika** | 40 | 10 | 12.75 | 12.6 | 12.9 |

1. **Question**: At today's prices, what's the total cost of buying 450 Safron shares and half as many Troika shares (to the nearest £100)?
   **Solution**:
   Safron Cost: 450 shares × £13.8 = £6,210.
   Troika Quantity: 450 / 2 = 225 shares.
   Troika Cost: 225 shares × £12.75 = £2,868.75.
   Total Cost: £6,210 + £2,868.75 = £9,078.75.
   Rounding to the nearest £100 gives £9,100.
   **Answer**: 9,100

2. **Question**: For which share is the total yearly dividend valued at over 7% of today's share price?
   **Options**: Acorn, EDP, Jasone, Kilic, Soares, Safron, Troika
   **Solution**:
   Calculate (Total Dividend ÷ Today's Price) for each share. (Note: Convert dividend to pounds by dividing by 100).
   * Acorn: (45+15)p = £0.60. £0.60 ÷ £14 ≈ 4.3%
   * EDP: (15+60)p = £0.75. £0.75 ÷ £13.1 ≈ 5.7%
   * Jasone: (20+50)p = £0.70. £0.70 ÷ £12.5 = 5.6%
   * **Kilic**: (30+35)p = £0.65. £0.65 ÷ £9.25 ≈ **7.03%** (>7%)
   * Soares: (10+30)p = £0.40. £0.40 ÷ £8.1 ≈ 4.9%
   * Safron: (35+35)p = £0.70. £0.70 ÷ £13.8 ≈ 5.1%
   * Troika: (40+10)p = £0.50. £0.50 ÷ £12.75 ≈ 3.9%
   **Answer**: Kilic

3. **Question**: If today you sold 50,000 Kilic shares, after collecting the July-Dec dividend, how many Soares shares could you buy with the proceeds (to the nearest 1,000)?
   **Solution**:
   Proceeds from selling Kilic: 50,000 shares × £9.25 = £462,500.
   Dividends collected (July-Dec): 50,000 shares × 35p = 1,750,000p = £17,500.
   Total funds available: £462,500 + £17,500 = £480,000.
   Soares share price: £8.1.
   Number of Soares shares: £480,000 ÷ £8.1 ≈ 59,259.
   Rounding to the nearest 1,000 gives 59,000.
   **Answer**: 59,000

## Question 3
**Table 1: Average Daily Visitors to Magical Attraction’s main sites**

| | **Theme Park** | **Theme Park** | **Flower Park** | **Flower Park** | **Royal Park** | **Royal Park** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | **Entrance Fee** | **Visitor numbers** | **Entrance Fee** | **Visitor numbers** | **Entrance Fee** | **Visitor numbers** |
| **Children (<16 years)** | £7.50 | 3,250 | £6.00 | 1,550 | £4.50 | 1,850 |
| **Adults** | £11.00 | 2,850 | £10.00 | 3,100 | £9.00 | 4,120 |
| **Senior (>60 years)** | £5.70 | 1,200 | £4.50 | 4,450 | £6.75 | 1,990 |

**Price Concessions**
* 10% on all full-price tickets between 1 Dec to 31 Jan
* 15% for each member of a family of four or more members
* 20% for any member of a school trip

1. **Question**: What is the ratio of the entrance fee for an adult visiting Royal Park on 1st February compared to an adult visiting Theme Park on the previous day?
   **Options**: 6:3, 6:5, 6:7, 6:9, 6:11, 8:3, 8:5, 8:7, 8:9, 8:11, 10:3, 10:5, 10:7, 10:9, 10:11, 12:3, 12:5, 12:7, 12:9, 12:11
   **Solution**:
   * **Royal Park (1st Feb)**: 1st Feb is outside the discount window. The standard adult fee applies: **£9.00**.
   * **Theme Park (Previous Day - 31st Jan)**: 31st Jan falls within the "10% off" window (1 Dec to 31 Jan).
       Standard Fee = £11.00.
       Discounted Fee = £11.00 - (10% of £11.00) = £11.00 - £1.10 = **£9.90**.
   * **Ratio**: £9.00 : £9.90
       Divide both by 0.90 (or multiply by 10 to get 90:99, then divide by 9).
       90 / 9 = 10
       99 / 9 = 11
   **Answer**: 10:11

2. **Question**: How many people approximately (aged 60 years or under) visit Flower Park compared to Theme Park over a typical five-day period?

   **Solution**:
   * "Aged 60 years or under" refers to the **Children** and **Adults** categories.
   * **Theme Park Daily Visitors (<60)**:
       Children (3,250) + Adults (2,850) = **6,100**.
   * **Flower Park Daily Visitors (<60)**:
       Children (1,550) + Adults (3,100) = **4,650**.
   * **Daily Difference**: 6,100 - 4,650 = 1,450.
   * **Five-day Period Difference**: 1,450 × 5 = **7,250**.
   **Answer**: 7,250

3. **Question**: If the Flower Park raised its entrance fee by 5%, what would be the additional daily revenue across the board (to the nearest £)?
   **Options**: 3,000, 3,002, 3,004, 3,006, 3,008, 3,010, 3,012, 3,014, 3,016, 3,018, 3,020, 3,022, 3,024, 3,026, 3,028
   **Solution**:
   Calculate current daily revenue for Flower Park:
   * Children: 1,550 × £6.00 = £9,300
   * Adults: 3,100 × £10.00 = £31,000
   * Seniors: 4,450 × £4.50 = £20,025
   * **Total Daily Revenue**: £9,300 + £31,000 + £20,025 = **£60,325**.
   Calculate 5% increase:
   * £60,325 × 0.05 = **£3,016.25**.
   * Rounded to the nearest £: **3,016**.
   **Answer**: 3,016
